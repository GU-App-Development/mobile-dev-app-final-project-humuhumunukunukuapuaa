Team Name: Humuhumunukunukuapua'a
By: Dominic Bevilacqua and Katie Stevens


Abstract:
Our project aims to create a mobile game: a matching game similar to games like Candy Crush and Bejeweled. The game is implemented via Kotlin and Android Studio, and will (hopefully) be released to the Google Play Store. Our app doesn’t ‘address a problem’ per se, unless the problem is boredom. In regard to how we’ll address the ‘problem’ of boredom, games are inherently a solution to boredom, but we do aim to implement features to keep users consistently engaged (like high-scores, possibly game-modes, etc.).
