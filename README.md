# Abstract:
Our project is a matching game similar to games like Candy Crush and Bejeweled. The game is implemented via Kotlin and Android Studio, and will (hopefully) be released to the Google Play Store. Our app doesn’t ‘address a problem’ per se, unless the problem is boredom. In regard to how we’ll address the ‘problem’ of boredom, games are inherently a solution to boredom, but we do aim to implement features to keep users consistently engaged (like high-scores, possibly game-modes, etc.).

# Get Started:
Download the game. Should run in Android Studio without any configurations.

# Need Help?
If you have Android Studio, have the files installed, and have the project open, just Run the project.
If you still need help, don't contact us :^)
