# Abstract (what the project does & how it is useful):
Our project is a matching game similar to games like Candy Crush and Bejeweled. The game is implemented via Kotlin and Android Studio, and will (hopefully) be released to the Google Play Store. Our app doesn’t ‘address a problem’ per se, unless the problem is boredom. In regard to how we’ll address the ‘problem’ of boredom, games are inherently a solution to boredom, but we do aim to implement features to keep users consistently engaged (like high-scores, possibly game-modes, etc.).

# Get Started:
To run this game you need to install Android App Studio. The instructions to install Android App Studio can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/install).
Download the code for the game from this repository.
To run the game in Android App Studio you will need to add an Android Device Emulator. 
In Android App Studio, navigate to the Device Manager and add a new device. We suggest the Pixel 2 device but our app should run on most devices. 
You should be able to build and run the app on the emulated device.

# Need Help?
If you have Android Studio, have the files installed, and have the project open, just Run the project.
If you get some kind of 'SDK Missing' error, try: File -> Sync Project With Gradle Files.
If you still need help, don't contact us :^)
